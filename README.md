# E2E Demo Config
This repository contains the Kubernetes configuration code for a project that illustrates how to configure and execute end-to-end testing of a [k3s](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes cluster using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s/).

The application and testing code is in [e2e-argo-demo-app](https://github.com/stmcallister/e2e-argo-demo-app).
